I received an accountant diploma and realized that I absolutely do not want to be one.

I started taking my first steps in programming in 2019. I started by learning JavaCore on the site
_javarush.ru_. Then I knew about the RSS course and in September I began it. In the future, I want
to get a job in a large company like to EPAM.

  let maxIndex = arr.length - 1;

  while (minIndex &lt;= maxIndex) {
    let middleIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
    let guess = arr[middleIndex];
    if (guess === item) return middleIndex;
    if (guess > item) maxIndex = mid - 1;
    return (minIndex = middleIndex + 1);
    }
  }
```
